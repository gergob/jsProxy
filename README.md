ES6 Features - Use cases for Proxy

The blog is no longer available, but I strongly recommend that you follow along the [archived blog post](blog/post.md) and look at the examples one by one.

You should use a recent browser, preferably Chrome.

Some examples require that the code is running on a webserver and not opened from the filesystem. You can use the simple [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) npm module for that. Just start serving and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

If you don't want to bother hosting it for yourself, you can use our [GitHub-hosted page](https://gergob.github.io/jsProxy) instead.
